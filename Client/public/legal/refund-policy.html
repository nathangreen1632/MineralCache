    <h1>Returns & Refunds Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 15, 2025</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Thank you for purchasing through MineralCache. We want you to be confident in your experience.
        This policy explains when returns and refunds are available and how to request them.
    </p>

    <h2>Eligibility for a refund</h2>
    <p>Refunds are available only in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Damaged on arrival:</strong> the item was damaged in transit.</li>
        <li><strong>Misrepresented listing:</strong> the listing’s photos or description materially misstated the item (e.g., species, locality, size/dimensions, condition).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To be eligible, you must <strong>email within 48 hours of delivery</strong> and provide clear photo/video
        evidence (see “How to start a return”). “Delivery” means the carrier’s delivery scan or, if unavailable, the day the item was received.
    </p>

    <h2>How to start a return</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Email <a href="mailto:returns@mineralcache.com">returns@mineralcache.com</a> within 48 hours of delivery.</li>
        <li>Include your order number, item title/ID, and a description of the issue.</li>
        <li>Attach photos/videos of:
            <ul>
                <li>the outer shipping box and label,</li>
                <li>all internal packaging and materials,</li>
                <li>the unboxing (if available), and</li>
                <li>the item showing the damage or misrepresentation.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will reply with instructions and the correct return address for the vendor who shipped your item.</p>

    <h2>Return shipment requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All returns must be <strong>shipped within 14 days of delivery</strong>.</li>
        <li>Return the item in the condition received (even if damaged), including any original tags, bases, and labels.</li>
        <li>Use a trackable shipping method; keep your receipt and tracking number. We recommend appropriate insurance.</li>
        <li>Return the item to the <strong>original vendor</strong> at the address we provide. Do not ship returns to MineralCache unless instructed.</li>
        <li>Keep all packaging until your claim is fully resolved; carriers may request inspection for damage claims.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>
        After the vendor receives and inspects the return, we will process your refund. Please allow up to
        <strong>7 business days</strong> from receipt of the return for processing. Depending on your card issuer,
        the credit may take one billing cycle to appear on your statement. You will receive an email confirmation when processed.
    </p>

    <h2>Important notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Returns are <strong>not</strong> accepted for buyer’s remorse.</li>
        <li>Returns are <strong>not</strong> accepted for misunderstandings about size, locality, or quality when that information was accurately provided in the listing. If the listing is found to be inaccurate, the item is eligible under “Misrepresented listing.”</li>
        <li>Auction wins are <strong>not</strong> returnable except for shipping damage (with sufficient evidence) or verified listing misrepresentation.</li>
        <li>Orders containing items from multiple vendors may require separate returns to each vendor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Misrepresented listing:</strong> a material mismatch between the item received and the listing’s essential characteristics (e.g., species, locality, dimensions, condition). Minor variations in color or appearance due to photography and display differences are not considered misrepresentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> clear photos/videos of packaging and the item that reasonably demonstrate damage or misrepresentation.</li>
    </ul>
