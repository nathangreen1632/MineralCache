    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        These Vendor Terms (“Vendor Terms”) apply to sellers using the MineralCache marketplace. They form part of our
        <a href="/legal#tos">Terms of Service</a> and incorporate our
        <a href="/legal#shipping">Shipping Policy</a>, <a href="/legal#refund">Returns &amp; Refunds Policy</a>,
        <a href="/legal#copyright">Copyright &amp; IP Policy</a>, <a href="/legal#privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, and
        <a href="/legal#dpa">Data Processing Addendum</a>. By listing items or accepting orders, you agree to these Vendor Terms.
    </p>

        <li>Provide clear photos of the actual item for sale. Watermarks, if used, must not obscure essential details. Do not use images or text without rights; see our <a href="/legal#copyright">IP Policy</a>.</li>
        <li>Disclose provenance when known. Do not imply certifications you do not have.</li>

        <li>Ship to the address on the order. Changes require buyer confirmation on-platform.</li>
