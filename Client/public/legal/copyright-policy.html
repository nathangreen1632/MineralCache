    <h2>Ownership of site content</h2>
    <p>
        The MineralCache website, brand, text, graphics, logos, UI elements, compilations, and other materials we make
        available (“MineralCache Materials”) are owned by MineralCache or our licensors and are protected by copyright
        and other intellectual property laws. Except as expressly permitted, you may not copy, modify, distribute, sell,
        or lease any part of the MineralCache Materials.
    </p>

    <h2>Vendor & user content</h2>
    <p>
        Vendors and users may upload listings, descriptions, photos, videos, and other content (“User Content”). You
        represent and warrant that you own or have all necessary rights to the User Content you submit and that your
        submission and use on MineralCache do not infringe the rights of any third party, including copyrights,
        trademarks, rights of publicity, or privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are solely responsible for your User Content. Do not upload content you did not create or do not have
        permission to use. Avoid using watermarked assets, scraped images, or materials created by others without a
        valid license.
    </p>

    <h2>License you grant to MineralCache</h2>
    <p>
        By submitting User Content, you grant MineralCache a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable
        license to host, store, reproduce, adapt, format, publicly display, publicly perform, translate, and distribute
        your User Content in connection with operating, promoting, and improving the marketplace and our services. This
        license continues for as long as your content is available on the service and for a reasonable period
        thereafter to support archival, audit, and legal compliance purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Prohibited IP-infringing content</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Content that copies or closely imitates another creator’s photos, media, or text without permission.</li>
        <li>Use of third-party trademarks in a way likely to cause confusion about source, affiliation, or sponsorship.</li>
        <li>Uploads that include another person’s name, likeness, or personal data without consent.</li>
        <li>Counterfeit goods or listings that misrepresent origin, authorship, or authenticity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Trademarks</h2>
    <p>
        “MineralCache” and associated logos are trademarks or service marks of MineralCache. Third-party names, logos,
        and marks are the property of their respective owners and used for identification only. Any use of
        MineralCache marks requires our prior written permission.
    </p>

    <h2>DMCA takedown notices</h2>
    <p>If you believe material on MineralCache infringes your copyright, your notice should include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>
        <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.</li>
        <li>Identification of the material claimed to be infringing and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate it (URL or listing link).</li>
        <li>Your contact information (name, address, telephone number, email).</li>
        <li>A statement that you have a good-faith belief the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
        <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Send notices to: <a href="mailto:legal@mineralcache.com">legal@mineralcache.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Upon receiving a compliant notice, we may remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material and notify the affected user or vendor.</p>

    <h2>Counter-notice procedure</h2>
    <p>If your content was removed due to a DMCA notice and you believe it was a mistake or misidentification, your counter-notice should include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>
        <li>Identification of the material that has been removed and the location where it previously appeared.</li>
        <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief the material was removed as a result of mistake or misidentification.</li>
        <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for your address and will accept service of process from the original complainant.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Send counter-notices to: <a href="mailto:legal@mineralcache.com">legal@mineralcache.com</a>.</p>
    <p>If we receive a valid counter-notice, we may restore the content unless the complainant informs us they have filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the allegedly infringing activity.</p>

    <h2>Repeat infringer policy</h2>
    <p>
        MineralCache may, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, terminate or suspend accounts of users and
        vendors determined to be repeat infringers. We may also remove content alleged to infringe without prior notice.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-party materials</h2>
    <p>
        The site may include links to or embeddings of third-party content. MineralCache does not control and is not
        responsible for such materials. Use of third-party content may be subject to separate terms and licenses.
    </p>

    <h2>Reporting IP concerns</h2>
