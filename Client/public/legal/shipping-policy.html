    <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 15, 2025</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This Shipping Policy is part of our Terms of Service and applies to any order placed through the MineralCache
        marketplace. Please review it before purchasing. Vendors are responsible for shipping their own items and for
        meeting the requirements below.
    </p>

    <h2>Shipping guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dispatch time:</strong> Orders must be shipped within seven (7) business days of payment confirmation.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Vendors (and/or MineralCache, where applicable) must provide accurate tracking information.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> Items must be packaged securely to prevent damage in transit.</li>
        <li><strong>Listing clarity:</strong> Each listing must clearly state shipping cost, carrier/service, and delivery estimate.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Vendors must comply with all applicable shipping laws and regulations, including accurate customs declarations for international shipments (if enabled in the future).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Wrong address</h2>
    <p>
        You are responsible for entering a complete and correct shipping address. If you submitted an incorrect address,
        contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:support@mineralcache.com">support@mineralcache.com</a>. Address
        changes may not be possible after an order is processed or shipped.
    </p>

    <h2>Lost, stolen, or marked delivered</h2>
    <p>
        If tracking shows “delivered” but you did not receive your package, or if your shipment is marked lost by the
        carrier, promptly contact the carrier and notify us. MineralCache and vendors are not responsible for packages
        after a valid carrier delivery scan. We will assist with reasonable carrier inquiries or claims, but replacement
        or refund is not guaranteed unless covered by our <a href="/legal/returns-refunds-policy">Returns &amp; Refunds Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Delivery options & estimates</h2>
    <p>Typical options offered by vendors include the following USPS Priority Flat Rate services:</p>

            <th>Price</th>

        </tr>
        </thead>
