        You must be at least 18 years old to register or purchase.
    </p>

    <h2>Account & eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You agree to provide accurate information and keep it updated.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for all activity under your account and for safeguarding your credentials.</li>
        <li>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or applicable law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Marketplace nature</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            MineralCache is a platform where independent sellers list and sell products directly to buyers.
            Unless expressly stated, MineralCache is not the seller of items listed by third-party vendors.
        </li>
        <li>Sellers are responsible for product details, pricing, inventory, shipping, and legal compliance.</li>
        <li>Buyers are responsible for reviewing listings and providing accurate shipping details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Products, pricing, and availability</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We strive for accuracy, but color, size, and appearance may vary based on photography and displays.</li>
        <li>Prices and availability are set by sellers and may change at any time. Errors may be corrected.</li>
        <li>
            Orders may be refused or canceled (e.g., suspected fraud, pricing errors, restricted items, or policy
            violations). Charges already paid will be refunded if canceled before fulfillment.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Payments, taxes, and shipping</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>Applicable taxes and shipping charges are shown at checkout.</li>
        <li>Shipping timelines and carriers are set by sellers. Title and risk of loss transfer upon carrier acceptance unless required otherwise by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Returns and refunds</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Intellectual property</h2>

    <p>Your use of the Services is governed by our <a href="/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        The Services are provided “as is” and “as available.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all
        warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
        We do not control third-party sellers and are not responsible for their statements or conduct.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will MineralCache be liable for indirect, incidental, special,
        consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill. Our aggregate liability
        for claims relating to the Services will not exceed the amount you paid to MineralCache for the transaction(s)
        giving rise to the claim during the six (6) months before the claim arose.
    </p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>
        We may suspend or terminate access to the Services at any time for any reason, including violations of these Terms.
        You may stop using the Services at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>Disputes; governing law</h2>

        <li>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflicts of law.</li>
        <li>Before filing a claim, the parties will try in good faith to resolve disputes informally for 30 days after written notice.</li>

            Except where prohibited, disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration in Travis County, Texas, on an

    <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be posted on the Services and, where required,
        we will notify you. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
    </p>

            These Terms, together with policies referenced here (including
            <a href="/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy</a> and <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">Cookies</a>), form the entire agreement between
