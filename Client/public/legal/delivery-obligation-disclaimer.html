    <h1>Delivery Obligation Disclaimer</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 15, 2025</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        MineralCache, LLC (“MineralCache,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) operates an online multivendor marketplace that
        connects customers (“you”) with independent third-party vendors (“Vendors”). MineralCache does not
        manufacture, warehouse, package, or ship the products sold by Vendors and is not a party to the delivery
        contract between you, the Vendor, and any shipping carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
        By placing an order through MineralCache, you acknowledge and agree to this Delivery Obligations Disclaimer.
        This Disclaimer works together with our <a href="/legal#tos">Terms of Service</a> and other posted policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Marketplace role only</h2>
    <p>
        MineralCache provides a platform for Vendors to list, market, and sell products directly to customers. Each
        Vendor is an independent business responsible for fulfilling, packaging, and shipping its own orders.
    </p>
    <p>
        MineralCache does not control, and is not responsible for, any Vendor’s shipping methods, handling practices,
        packaging quality, carrier selection, or delivery timelines. Any representations about shipping or delivery
        (including estimated delivery dates, carrier options, or special services) are made by the Vendor or the
        carrier, not by MineralCache.
    </p>

    <h2>Vendor shipping and delivery responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
        Vendors are solely responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Preparing and packaging items for shipment in a manner suitable for transport;</li>
        <li>Selecting carriers and service levels (for example, standard, expedited, insured);</li>
        <li>Generating and providing tracking information, where available; and</li>
        <li>Complying with applicable laws, regulations, and carrier policies for shipping and delivery.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        MineralCache may display tracking information or status updates as provided by Vendors and carriers, but does
        not guarantee their accuracy, completeness, or timeliness.
    </p>

    <h2>Customer responsibilities at checkout</h2>
    <p>
        You are responsible for providing a complete, accurate, and deliverable shipping address at checkout, including
        any relevant apartment, suite, unit, or building details.
    </p>
    <p>
        MineralCache and Vendors are not responsible for non-delivery, misdelivery, delays, or additional fees arising
        from:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Incorrect, incomplete, or outdated shipping information you provide;</li>
        <li>Your failure to receive, retrieve, or collect a package after delivery is attempted or completed; or</li>
        <li>Your refusal of delivery.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any additional charges (such as re-delivery fees, storage fees, or return shipping fees) resulting from these
        issues may be your responsibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Delivery, risk of loss, and carrier issues</h2>
    <p>
        To the extent permitted by applicable law, title and risk of loss for items you purchase pass to you when the
        Vendor delivers the items to the carrier for shipment. Once the carrier marks a package as “delivered” to the
        shipping address you provided, MineralCache is not responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Theft, “porch piracy,” or loss after delivery;</li>
        <li>Damage occurring after the carrier has confirmed delivery; or</li>
        <li>Packages delivered to common areas, mailrooms, concierge desks, package lockers, or similar locations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Claims relating to delays, packages lost in transit, or carrier mishandling may need to be submitted directly
        to the carrier and are subject to the carrier’s procedures and limitations. MineralCache may, in its sole
        discretion, assist with such issues but is not obligated to do so.
    </p>

    <h2>Inspection upon delivery</h2>
    <p>
        You agree to promptly inspect all items upon delivery. This includes verifying that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The items received match what you ordered;</li>
        <li>The quantities received are correct; and</li>
        <li>The items are not visibly damaged or obviously defective on arrival.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If someone else accepts delivery on your behalf (for example, a building manager, receptionist, mailroom,
        roommate, or neighbor), you are deemed to have received the order when the carrier marks it as delivered.
    </p>

    <h2>Reporting delivery issues</h2>
    <p>
        Any issues regarding <strong>missing, incorrect, or visibly damaged items</strong> must be reported to
        MineralCache within <strong>three (3) business days</strong> of the delivery date shown in the carrier’s
        tracking information.
    </p>
    <p>
        To report an issue, contact us at
        <a href="mailto:support@mineralcache.com">support@mineralcache.com</a> (or through any support form we provide)
        and include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your full name and contact information;</li>
        <li>Your MineralCache order number;</li>
        <li>Clear photographs of the packaging and affected item(s), where applicable; and</li>
        <li>A detailed description of the issue (for example, what is missing, incorrect, or damaged).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        MineralCache may share your claim and any documentation you provide with the relevant Vendor(s) and/or carrier(s)
        to help investigate and attempt to resolve the issue.
    </p>

    <h2>Effect of late notice</h2>
    <p>
        If you do not notify MineralCache of a delivery issue within the three (3) business day period described above,
        you may lose eligibility for investigation, replacement, refund, or other remedies through MineralCache.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, failure to provide timely notice as required in this Disclaimer
        constitutes your waiver and forfeiture of any claim against MineralCache arising out of or relating to missing,
        incorrect, or damaged items in the affected order, and may limit your recourse to direct claims against the
        Vendor and/or carrier.
    </p>

    <h2>Remedies and limitations</h2>
    <p>
        Any remedy offered in response to a delivery-related claim (including replacement, partial refund, full refund,
        or store credit) is discretionary and may depend on:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The nature and severity of the issue;</li>
        <li>The evidence and documentation you provide;</li>
        <li>The Vendor’s policies and cooperation; and</li>
        <li>Applicable law and carrier rules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        MineralCache does not guarantee that every claim will result in a refund, replacement, or other remedy.
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, MineralCache’s total liability for any delivery-related claim will not
        exceed the amount you actually paid through the MineralCache platform for the affected item(s).
    </p>

    <h2>No warranty and limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
        Delivery dates and timeframes are estimates only and are not guaranteed. MineralCache is not liable for any
        delay in delivery caused by Vendors, carriers, weather, natural disasters, labor disputes, customs or export
        controls, governmental actions, or any other event beyond our reasonable control.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, MineralCache disclaims all warranties, express or implied, relating to
        shipping and delivery, including any warranties of timeliness, condition upon arrival, or suitability of
        carriers selected by Vendors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under no circumstances will MineralCache be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or
        punitive damages arising out of or in connection with shipping or delivery, including without limitation lost
        profits, loss of opportunity, or loss of use, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
    </p>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
        You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless MineralCache, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
        and agents from and against any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable
        attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your failure to provide accurate or complete shipping information;</li>
        <li>Your failure to timely report delivery issues as required by this Disclaimer;</li>
        <li>Your misuse, improper handling, or resale of delivered products; or</li>
        <li>Any dispute between you and a Vendor or carrier regarding shipping or delivery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to this Delivery Obligations Disclaimer</h2>

        We may update this Delivery Obligations Disclaimer from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last
        updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of MineralCache after any changes become effective
