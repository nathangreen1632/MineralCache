    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>

    <hr />

    <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
    <p>
        Cookies are small text files stored on your device by a website. They help websites work, keep you signed in, remember preferences, and understand how people use the site. We also use similar technologies like localStorage and pixels. This Policy explains what we use and how you can control it.
    </p>

    <h2>How we use cookies on MineralCache</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Essential (required):</strong> Keep you signed in, protect your account, and let the checkout and vendor tools work. Without these, the site cannot function.</li>
        <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Remember choices such as theme, layout, and dismissed notices so you don’t have to set them every time.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance and analytics:</strong> Help us understand site usage to improve speed, reliability, and features. When enabled, we may use third-party analytics (e.g., Google Analytics).</li>
        <li><strong>Payments and security:</strong> Support secure payments and fraud prevention through providers like Stripe.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> We do not use third-party advertising cookies on MineralCache at this time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cookie-like technologies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>localStorage/sessionStorage:</strong> Stored in your browser by the site. We use these for things like remembering non-sensitive UI states (for example, a dismissed banner) and temporary flow states (for example, pending legal acceptance before account creation).</li>
        <li><strong>Pixels:</strong> Small code snippets that can measure actions such as page views or conversions if analytics are enabled.</li>
        <li><strong>Web beacons/SDKs:</strong> Used sparingly, and only to provide core functionality or analytics described here.</li>
    </ul>
