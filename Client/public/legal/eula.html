    <hr />

    <h2>1. Parties; Instrument; Incorporation</h2>
    <p>
        This End User License Agreement (“<strong>Agreement</strong>”) is a legally binding instrument between
        MineralCache, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“<strong>Licensor</strong>,” “<strong>MineralCache</strong>,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), and the
        individual or legal entity that accesses or uses the Services (defined below) (“<strong>Licensee</strong>,” “you,” or “your”). This Agreement governs
        the use of MineralCache’s client applications, websites, APIs, and any related software components, documentation, and interfaces
        made available by MineralCache (collectively, the “<strong>Software</strong>”) as deployed to enable the MineralCache multi-vendor marketplace and ancillary
        functionality (collectively, with the Software, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). The MineralCache <a href="/legal#tos">Terms of Service</a> and
        <a href="/legal#privacy">Privacy Policy</a> are hereby incorporated <em>mutatis mutandis</em> by this reference.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Grant; Scope; Reservation</h2>
    <p>
        Subject to continuous compliance with this Agreement, MineralCache grants Licensee a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
        non-sublicensable, limited license to access and use the Software, solely in executable form, solely in connection with the Services, and
        solely for Licensee’s internal, lawful, ordinary-course buying and selling (or prospective buying and selling) of minerals, fossils, gemstones,
        and related goods on the MineralCache marketplace. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by MineralCache and its licensors.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Credentials; Account Control; Allocation of Risk</h2>
    <p>
        Access to the Software requires valid credentials issued by MineralCache. Licensee shall maintain strict control over credentials,
        systems, and devices used to access the Services and is, <em>ipso facto</em>, responsible for all use occurring under Licensee’s accounts,
        whether or not authorized, and for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures commensurate with the sensitivity
        of data processed via the Services.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Permitted Use; Technical Parameters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the Software only via documented interfaces and only at volumes, rates, and methods consistent with published specifications.</li>
        <li>Maintain at all times a network, browser, and device environment that is currently supported by MineralCache.</li>
        <li>Promptly install or accept updates, patches, or configuration changes issued by MineralCache, which may be <em>de rigueur</em> for continued operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Prohibitions; High-Risk Activities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No copying, framing, translating, adapting, decompiling, disassembling, reverse engineering, or creating derivative works of the Software, except to the minimal extent that a restriction is unenforceable under applicable law.</li>
        <li>No scraping, bulk extraction, or automated harvesting of marketplace data; no benchmarking disclosure without prior written consent.</li>
        <li>No circumvention of access controls, rate limits, or security; no introduction of malware or harmful code.</li>
        <li>No use for purposes that are unlawful, defamatory, infringing, or violative of sanctions/export laws; the Services are not designed for life-support, emergency, or other high-risk environments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Marketplace Status; Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
        Licensee acknowledges that MineralCache is a platform provider and, except where expressly stated, is not the seller of third-party listings.
        Vendors control their listings, pricing, inventory, and fulfillment. Payment processing may be facilitated by independent processors
        and card networks. Third-party components, libraries, and services utilized by or interoperating with the Software remain subject to their
        respective licenses and policies, which Licensee must review independently.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Content; Rights; License Back</h2>
    <p>
        As between the parties, Licensee retains ownership of content it uploads or submits (“<strong>User Content</strong>”).
        Licensee hereby grants MineralCache a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, cache, transmit, reproduce, display, and process
        User Content solely as necessary to provide, secure, and improve the Services; to comply with law; and to enforce policies. Licensee represents
        and warrants that it has all rights necessary to grant the foregoing license and that User Content does not violate law or third-party rights.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Feedback; Derivative Learnings</h2>
    <p>
        Suggestions, requests, ideas, or other feedback concerning the Services (“<strong>Feedback</strong>”) are provided voluntarily and
        may be used by MineralCache without restriction or obligation of attribution or compensation. Aggregate, de-identified telemetry,
        usage statistics, and operational learnings derived from Licensee’s use may be exploited by MineralCache to operate and improve the Services.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Updates; Modifications; Suspension</h2>
    <p>
        MineralCache may modify, replace, or discontinue the Software or any feature thereof with or without notice; issue mandatory updates;
        or suspend access for maintenance, security, legal compliance, or suspected breach. Where practicable, MineralCache endeavors to minimize
        material regressions affecting core marketplace functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Data Protection; Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Processing of personal data under this Agreement shall be in accordance with the MineralCache <a href="/legal#privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
        Licensee shall not use the Services to process special categories of personal data, payment card data outside supported checkout flows, or
        data subject to sectoral laws requiring controls materially beyond those described in the Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Fees; Taxes; Chargebacks</h2>
    <p>
        Where applicable, Licensee shall pay fees, commissions, or other charges described in the Services or a separate schedule. Prices are exclusive
        of taxes. Licensee is responsible for chargebacks, reversals, and penalties attributable to its transactions, <em>inter alia</em>, those arising
        from misdescription, non-delivery, or policy non-compliance.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Term; Termination; Effect</h2>
    <p>
        This Agreement commences upon first access and continues until terminated. MineralCache may terminate or suspend access immediately for breach,
        legal necessity, or security risk. Licensee may terminate by ceasing use. Upon termination, all rights granted herein cease, and Licensee shall
        discontinue use and destroy or purge any locally cached fragments of the Software within its possession or control. Sections intended by their
        nature to survive (including 2, 5–8, 10–17) shall so survive.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Export; Sanctions; Government Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Licensee shall comply with U.S. and international export, re-export, and sanctions regulations and shall not access or use the Software in embargoed
        jurisdictions or for prohibited end uses. The Software is “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” as those
        terms are used in FAR/DFARS, licensed to U.S. Government users with only those rights set forth herein.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
        Licensee shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless MineralCache and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against
        any third-party claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to
        (a) User Content; (b) Licensee’s use of the Services in violation of this Agreement, law, or third-party rights; or (c) transactions between
        Licensee and third-party vendors or buyers.

        PAID BY LICENSEE TO MINERALCACHE FOR THE SERVICES, IF ANY, DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.

        individual (non-class) basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief for actual or threatened
        misappropriation or infringement in any court of competent jurisdiction.
