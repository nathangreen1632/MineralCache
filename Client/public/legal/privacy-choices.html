    <h1>Your Privacy Choices — We Do Not Sell or Share Personal Information</h1>

    <h2>Our commitment</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is yours. MineralCache will never sell anyone’s personal information—buyers, vendors, or admins.
        We do not “sell” or “share” personal information as those terms are defined under U.S. state privacy laws
        (including CPRA), and we do not use personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>No sale or sharing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not sell personal information for money or anything of value.</li>
        <li>We do not share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li>
        <li>We do not allow our service providers to use your data for their own purposes—except where applicable for audit purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Service providers and processors</h2>
    <p>
        We use service providers (for example, payments, hosting, email) under contracts that restrict their use of
        personal information to performing services for us. For vendor storefront operations, we act as a processor
        under our <a href="/legal#dpa">Data Processing Addendum</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Sensitive personal information</h2>
    <p>
        We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information to infer characteristics or for unrelated purposes.
        If that ever changes, we will update this page and provide required choices.
    </p>

    <h2>Global Privacy Control (GPC)</h2>
    <p>
        We honor applicable browser signals such as GPC. Today, because we do not sell or share personal information,
        there is nothing for GPC to opt out of on our site.
    </p>

    <h2>Your privacy rights</h2>
    <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or obtain a copy of your personal
        information. To exercise these rights, contact us using the methods below. We will verify your request and
        respond as required by law.

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
        If our practices change, we will update this page and our
        <a href="/legal#privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. If we ever begin selling or sharing personal information,
        we will provide a clear opt-out link and honor your choices.
