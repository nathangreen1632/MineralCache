            <strong>Marketplace activity</strong> where sharing is necessary to complete a transaction (e.g.,

    <h2>Your choices and rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Access, update, delete</strong>: you may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your
            personal information, subject to legal exceptions. Contact

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cookies</strong>: control cookies in your browser settings; some features may not work without
            certain cookies. See our <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Targeted advertising and analytics controls</strong>: use browser or platform settings,
            the Google Analytics opt-out, or supported global controls like Global Privacy Control (GPC). We
            honor GPC where required.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>US state privacy rights</strong>: depending on your state (e.g., CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, IN, IA,

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We keep personal information only as long as needed for the purposes described in this Policy, to comply
        with legal and accounting obligations, and to resolve disputes. When no longer needed, we delete or
        de-identify information.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the nature of the data. No system
        is 100% secure; transmission of information is at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
        MineralCache is for users 18+. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 18. If you
        believe a child has provided personal data, contact us, and we will delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>Do-Not-Track and global controls</h2>
    <p>
        Industry standards for browser Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals are not uniform, so we do not respond to DNT at
        this time. Where required by law, we honor applicable global opt-out signals such as GPC.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Policy from time to time. Material changes will be posted on the Services and, where
        required, we will notify you. Your continued use of the Services after changes become effective means you
        accept the updated Policy.
